# custom_agg_function:

This aggregate function has been developed to calculate the minimum and maximum values for any column of integer, numeric, or float data types. This versatile function supports a wide range of numeric data types and presents its output in the following format:

`max_value -> min_value`

# How it works:
The script incorporates an aggregate function named max_to_min(anyelement). This function should be invoked within a SELECT statement to operate effectively. Additionally, the script includes other complementary functions within the script directory.


# Customize the output:
You have the flexibility to customize the output by utilizing the maxmin_finalfunc(jsonb) return type. This return type treats the overall result as text, allowing for tailored output presentation.

# Testing:
To ensure the functionality and reliability of this function, supporting test cases, sample data, and queries have been included. These elements can be used to validate the performance of the custom aggregate function.
